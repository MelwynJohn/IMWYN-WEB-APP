                extremely challenging. A document's Table Of Contents (TOC) provides an overall structure of a document, such as chapters and appendixes. Hence, TOC recognition enables more effect analyze OCR documents effectively. Most existing related
                works are based on textual features, such as keywords and font sizes. However, textual-based TOC recognition in OCR often fail when OCR documents are complex. In this study, we develop a novel image-based machine learning approach for
                recognition of TOC, where one-dimensional horizontal projections of TOC are proposed for classifying TOC and non-TOC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to recognize TOC by image-based analysis. We evaluated the proposed
